OBJECTIVES-
   To predict whether a water sample is potable or not based on its chemical attributes.
   To evaluate the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in classifying water potability.
   To assess the model using appropriate metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   To understand the importance of data preprocessing in predictive performance.


 ---All of the things done above were part of  course project of CL653 -Applications of machine learning and artificial Intelligence in Chemical Engineering.
 ---Later modifications include comparison of various ML models over the same data . Below are the results -
