Objectives

    Predict whether a water sample is potable or not based on its chemical attributes.

    Evaluate the performance of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) in classifying water potability.

    Assess the model using metrics including accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

    Understand the importance of data preprocessing in predictive performance.
